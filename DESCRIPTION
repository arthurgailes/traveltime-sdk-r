Description: traveltimeR is a R SDK for Travel Time API (https://traveltime.com/).
  Travel Time API helps users find locations by journey time rather than using ‘as the crow flies’ distance.
  Time-based searching gives users more opportunities for personalisation and delivers a more relevant search.
